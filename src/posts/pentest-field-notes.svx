Even when the scope is small, deliberate structure keeps engagements predictable. Here is the living checklist I follow on internships and lab environments.

## 1. Recon without tunnel vision

I split discovery into two passes:

1. *Wide*: ASN, subdomain, and service enumeration with automation (amass, naabu, nuclei).  
2. *Deep*: Manual review of exposed panels and protocol quirks. Anything weird goes into a `risk.md` file for the report later.

## 2. Crafting useful notes

- Start a `findings/<service>.md` note the moment something looks suspicious.  
- Capture raw requests/responses and hashes of downloaded binaries for integrity.  
- Write **mitigation ideas** next to every finding so the eventual report is action-oriented.

## 3. Controlled exploitation

When I exploit something, I immediately document:

- Payload used (include encoding steps)  
- Service / host context  
- Privesc impact and persistence strategy

Having this detail means I can reproduce the impact on-demand for stakeholders.

## 4. Debrief rituals

After every engagement I grade myself on:

- Signal-to-noise ratio in reporting  
- Time spent on dead ends  
- Tooling friction points

This feedback loop keeps me improving faster than just hopping between random labs.
